How two party hold their own ideas, which are both valid, yet solution can not handle both.

Then a new idea come to help, which is either from a different point of view, 

or, a more generalized solution which take care of both use cases.

So, the importent thing here is, when can't go further, try to step out. Try to focus on the 

use case, not the solution. Try to have a general solution, abstract.

Another option, is think about the use case, if it's an edge case, can we relax, less robust.
